      It is everywhere.<br>
      It is all around us.<br>
      Even now, in this very room.<br>
      You can see it when you look out your window,<br>
      or when you turn on your television.<br>
      You can feel it when you go to work,<br>
      when you go to church,<br>
      when you pay your taxes.<br>
      It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes,<br>
      to blind you from the truth.
