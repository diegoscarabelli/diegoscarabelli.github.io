<blockquote style="font-size:1em; border-left:4px solid #ccc; margin:0 auto; display:inline-block; text-align:left; max-width:600px; font-style:normal;">
It's everywhere.<br>
It's all around us.<br>
You can see it when you look out your window,<br>
or when you turn on your television.<br>
You can feel it when you go to work,<br>
when you pay your taxes.<br>
<br>
It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes,<br>
to blind you from the truth.
